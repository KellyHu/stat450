## Introduction
I'm Jingyi Huang. I'm a fourth-year student majoring in Statistics. I love working with data and find the pattern behind the data.

## Favorite equation: Least Squares equation
$$\hat{y} = a + bx$$
I like this equation because we can use this to estimate and make perdiction given the data.

## Data and the plot

I like this dataset because it comes from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions. In this way, we can understand more about the growth process of the plant and take care of it better.



```{r PlantGrowth, echo=FALSE}
x<- data("PlantGrowth")
head(PlantGrowth,5)
plot(PlantGrowth)
```
